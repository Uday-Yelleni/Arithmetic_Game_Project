            <h2>Game Rules and How to Play:</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Arithmetic Game! The goal is to practice basic arithmetic operations and improve your math skills. Here’s how to play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number of Questions:</strong> You can choose how many questions you'd like to answer. The more questions, the more challenging the game becomes!</li>
                <li><strong>Choose Operations:</strong> Select the operations you want to practice. You can choose from Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.</li>
                <li><strong>Operand Range:</strong> Set the minimum and maximum digits for the operands in the questions. This will affect the difficulty of the math problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Timer Option:</strong> You can opt for a timer to add an extra challenge. If you enable the timer, you’ll have to answer within the time limit you set in seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Answering the Questions:</strong> Once the game starts, you will be given a set of math problems based on the operations you selected. Enter your answers and click 'Submit' to check your response.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> After each question, you’ll receive feedback on whether your answer is correct or incorrect. At the end of the game, you’ll see a summary of your performance including correct answers, incorrect answers, and your overall score.</li>
            </ul>
